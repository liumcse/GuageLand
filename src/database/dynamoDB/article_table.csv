"1","Since today is Valentine's Day, I decided to make today's Navajo Word of the Day ""Ayóó'ánííníshní,"" which means, ""I Love You!"" As a bonus, I also include how you would say Valentine's Day in Navajo. So, there are two ways to say it. Some people say ""Hajéí Béédahaniih,"" which means, ""Remembering the Heart."" Other people say ""Ayóó'ádajó'nínígíí Béédahaniih,"" which means ""Rememberinng the Loved Ones!"" Enjoy & Happy Valentine's Day!","Daybreak Warrior","2/15/2012","http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/6085/samples/4221","Music","/Navajo Word of the Day - ""I Love You"""
