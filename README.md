## Inspiration

A Land for indigenous languages! Build indigenous languages on your Land and level up your house by clearing everyday tasks!

Form a worldwide collaboration to save endangered languages by sharing their language culture!

## What it does

Our GuageLand Project is fully open source and connects to FOSSASIA technologies. It applies gamification to tackle challenges related to indigenous languages.

## Challenges we ran into

We face a number of challenges, for example how to effectively stimulate people to share indigenous languages, how to design a creative environment to solve problems, how to improve our user experience, and how to engage relevant organizations into our Guageland community. We're very proud of our teamwork and accomplishment!
